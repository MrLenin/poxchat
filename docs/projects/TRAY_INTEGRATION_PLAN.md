# System Tray Integration Plan: LizardByte/tray Library

## Overview
Restore system tray functionality to PoxChat GTK4 by integrating the [LizardByte/tray](https://github.com/LizardByte/tray) library. This replaces the deprecated GtkStatusIcon that was removed in GTK4.

**Current Status:** ✅ Windows implementation complete
**Integration Method:** Git submodule
**Icon Format:** Native .ico files for Windows

> **Note:** Linux and macOS support are required for this migration to be considered complete. Linux and macOS implementations will be added in future phases.

## Library Choice: LizardByte/tray vs dmikushin/tray

Initially we used [dmikushin/tray](https://github.com/dmikushin/tray), but switched to [LizardByte/tray](https://github.com/LizardByte/tray) for better cross-platform support:

| Feature | dmikushin/tray | LizardByte/tray |
|---------|----------------|-----------------|
| Windows backend | Shell_NotifyIconW | Shell_NotifyIconW (same) |
| Linux backend | Qt6 (C++) | libayatana-appindicator (C) |
| macOS backend | Cocoa/AppKit | Cocoa/AppKit (same) |
| Language | C with C++ on Linux | C99 compatible |
| GTK compatibility | Qt6 conflicts with GTK | Native GTK integration |

LizardByte/tray is a fork that replaces the Qt6 Linux backend with libayatana-appindicator, making it more suitable for GTK applications. LizardByte hopes to eventually merge their changes back into dmikushin/tray.

### API Differences
- Source files are in `src/` subdirectory
- Uses `struct tray_menu` instead of `struct tray_menu_item`
- Uses `icon` field instead of `icon_filepath`
- Icons loaded on demand with caching
- Both left and right clicks show the context menu (no separate click callback)
- This menu-only behavior is consistent with Linux AppIndicator limitations

## Implementation Status

### ✅ Phase 1: Add Library as Git Submodule - COMPLETE

- Added `external/tray` submodule pointing to https://github.com/LizardByte/tray.git
- Created `.gitmodules` entry

### ✅ Phase 2: Create Windows .ico Icon Files - COMPLETE

Created icon files in `data/icons/`:
- `tray_normal.ico` - Normal state (green hexagon)
- `tray_message.ico` - Message notification (blue)
- `tray_highlight.ico` - Highlight notification (yellow/orange)
- `tray_fileoffer.ico` - DCC file offer (cyan/teal)

Icon specifications:
- Multi-resolution: 16x16 and 32x32 pixels
- 32-bit RGBA with transparency
- Generated from existing PNG files using Python Pillow

### ✅ Phase 3: Update Build System - COMPLETE

#### Visual Studio Project (`src/fe-gtk/fe-gtk.vcxproj`)
- Added `TRAY_EXPORTS` to preprocessor definitions
- Added `..\..\external\tray\src` to include directories
- Added `src/tray_windows.c` to ClCompile items
- Added `src/tray.h` to ClInclude items

#### Meson Build (`src/fe-gtk/meson.build`)
- Added conditional Windows tray source compilation
- Added tray include directory for Windows builds
- Source path: `../../external/tray/src/tray_windows.c`

#### Copy Project (`win32/copy/copy.vcxproj`)
- Added TrayIcons item group for ICO files
- Added copy command to deploy icons to `share\icons`
- Removed deprecated GTK3 conditional logic

#### GitHub Workflows
- Updated all workflows to use `actions/checkout@v4` with `submodules: recursive`
- Affected: `windows-build.yml`, `msys-build.yml`, `ubuntu-build.yml`, `flatpak-build.yml`

#### Installer (`win32/installer/poxchat.iss.tt`)
- Added tray icon files to installer

### ✅ Phase 4: Implement Tray Functionality - COMPLETE

Rewrote `src/fe-gtk/plugin-tray.c` with full Windows implementation:

#### Features Implemented
- Tray icon initialization and cleanup
- Context menu on click (Restore/Hide, Away, Back, Preferences, Quit)
- Icon flashing on notifications (private messages, highlights, DCC offers)
- Flash stops when window is focused
- Message count tracking for tooltip
- Window state preservation (position, maximized state)
- Away/Back command execution on hide/show

#### Event Hooks Registered
- Channel Msg Hilight, Channel Action Hilight
- Private Message, Private Message to Dialog
- Private Action, Private Action to Dialog
- Channel Message, Channel Action (when `hex_input_tray_chans` enabled)
- Invited
- DCC Offer
- Focus Window

### ✅ Phase 5: Minimize to Tray - COMPLETE

Added GTK4-compatible minimize-to-tray in `src/fe-gtk/maingui.c`:

- Added `mg_surface_state_cb()` to monitor GdkToplevel surface state
- Added `mg_realize_cb()` to connect surface state signal after window realization
- Connected `realize` signal on main window
- When minimized: intercepts `GDK_TOPLEVEL_STATE_MINIMIZED`, unminimizes window, then hides to tray

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Tray icon appears on startup (when `hex_gui_tray` enabled)
- [x] Click shows context menu with Restore/Hide option
- [x] Icon flashes on private message (when `hex_input_tray_priv` enabled)
- [x] Icon flashes on highlight (when `hex_input_tray_hilight` enabled)
- [x] Icon flashes on DCC offer
- [x] Flashing stops when window focused
- [x] "Close to tray" works (when `hex_gui_tray_close` enabled)
- [x] "Minimize to tray" works (when `hex_gui_tray_minimize` enabled)
- [x] Away/Back commands execute (when `hex_gui_tray_away` enabled)
- [x] Window position/state restored correctly
- [ ] Tooltip updates with message counts (needs verification)
- [x] Menu items work: Restore, Away, Back, Preferences, Quit
- [x] Tray icon removed on exit

## Future Work: Linux and macOS Support

### Linux Implementation (Future Phase)
The LizardByte/tray library uses libayatana-appindicator on Linux, which provides native GTK integration:

1. **Dependencies:** libayatana-appindicator3-dev (or libappindicator3-dev)
2. **Source file:** `external/tray/src/tray_linux.c`
3. **Build integration:** Add to meson.build with Linux detection

### macOS Implementation (Future Phase)
The LizardByte/tray library uses Cocoa/AppKit via Objective-C (`tray_darwin.m`). This requires:

1. Adding Objective-C compilation support to the build system
2. Linking Cocoa framework
3. Converting PNG icons to proper macOS format (~22pt height or vector PDF)

### Implementation Order
1. ~~Windows support~~ ✅ COMPLETE
2. ~~Verify Windows implementation works correctly~~ ✅ COMPLETE
3. Linux support (libayatana-appindicator backend)
4. macOS support (Objective-C integration)

## Technical Notes

### GTK4 Minimize Detection
GTK4 doesn't expose a `notify::minimized` property on GtkWindow. To detect window minimization:
1. Connect to the window's `realize` signal
2. In the realize handler, get the GdkSurface via `gtk_native_get_surface()`
3. Connect to the GdkToplevel's `notify::state` signal
4. Check for `GDK_TOPLEVEL_STATE_MINIMIZED` in the state callback

### LizardByte/tray Library Integration
- Uses `Shell_NotifyIconW` on Windows
- Requires `TRAY_EXPORTS` preprocessor define for proper DLL linkage
- Icon paths must be absolute paths to .ico files
- Menu items use `struct tray_menu` with text, disabled, checked, checkbox, cb, context, and submenu fields
- Both left and right clicks show the context menu (consistent with Linux AppIndicator)
- Icons are cached and loaded on demand

### Reference: Original GTK2 Implementation
Key patterns from commit `b544ac3350e85d4cc41fe3414cbdb82d75ce5d7a`:
- Used `GtkStatusIcon` with signals: `popup-menu`, `activate`, `notify::embedded`
- Flash timeout: 500ms
- Message count tracking for tooltip: `tray_priv_count`, `tray_pub_count`, etc.
- Window status via `poxchat_get_info(ph, "win_status")` returning "active", "normal", "hidden"
- Away status check via `tray_find_away_status()` iterating `serv_list`
